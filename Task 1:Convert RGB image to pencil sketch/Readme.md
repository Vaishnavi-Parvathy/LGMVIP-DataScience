Converting RGB IMAGE TO PENCIL_SKETCH:

Description:
This program read a RGB fomattted image and then convert it to a grayscale image. This will turn an image to a back and white photo. Then, it is converted to a negative image achieved by inverting gray image. After that we arrive at inverted gaussian blur image. Finally we get a pencil sketch image by minxing blur and gray scale images.
